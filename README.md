# Cisco Catalyst vs. Nexus Switches Overview Guide

**Description/Overview:** Cisco Catalyst and Nexus Switches are two of the most popular choices in networking switch solutions, but they serve two different overall use cases: Catalyst switches are traditionally used for corporate networks, while Nexus switches are a popular choice for data centers (and similar) with complex configuration needs. This guide will dive into the purposes, similarities, differences, and other implications of these two product lines.

Cisco Nexus switches are intended for implementation in data centers, as well as other data-heavy and mission-critical professional networks with advanced configuration and sustainability requirements. Cisco Nexus switches run on the Linux-based Cisco Nexus Operating System (NX-OS), which can optimize process automation, network security, availability, scalability, and performance. While this OS empowers networking professionals by providing complex and nuanced features, it also has a potentially steep learning curve.

Nexus switches are limited in how they employ link aggregation (which dynamically manages Ethernet channels): they commonly only support the open-standard Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) as their protocol for conducting this task. However, they do support a variety of media for connections, such as Ethernet, fiber, and Fiber Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) cabling.
